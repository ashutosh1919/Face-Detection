Face Detection Using OpenCV

I have used OpenCV library in python. I have programmed this project such that it is detecting faces both in images as well as videos. I have also put the facility to add images of anybody else. Photos will be stored in the people folder with the folder of your name. Then, algorithm will train the model based on all images stored in the people folder. And now, whenever you give the image or video, It will detect the face and shows the name of person if the images of the person is stored in the people folder, otherwise shows Unknown.

I have used three different algorithms to detect faces in images.
(1) Eigen Faces
(2) Fisher Faces
(3) LBPH Faces

I have used LBPH Faces algorithm to detect faces in Videos.
